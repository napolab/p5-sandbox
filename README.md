An environment for writing shaders with p5.js, running on vite and using react to render p5.js. This project also includes eslint and prettier.

## Getting started

To begin, run `npm i` and then `npm run dev`. Once you have that running, you can start editing the sample code located in `src/p5/sketches/sample`.

## Writing your own p5 code

To write your own p5 code, you can create a new directory under `src/p5/sketches`. You'll need to import your new code in `src/app/index.tsx`, which is where the sketch is rendered.
